## Self-Reflection:
It was difficult finding a tutorial that had a good middle ground between having good explanation, and not holding your hand too much.
This game was interesting because I had to revert to an older build of phaser. (2.0 instead of 3.0) so some of the code was different and I had to research fixes.
